Each time we interact, I start fresh without retaining information from previous discussions.\n\nFor securely storing important information like secret codes, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Using a password manager** (like Bitwarden, LastPass, or KeePass)\n2. **Writing it in a secure local file** that only you can access\n3. **Using encrypted notes** or secure storage apps\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you set up secure storage for your important information. Would you like assistance with that, or is there something else I can help you with today?",
