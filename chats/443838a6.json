Let me help you with this project.\n\nFirst, let me check what specific tools or frameworks you're currently using for this upgrade:Let me check with PowerShell:Let me try a simpler command:Perfect! I can see you have an AI assistant project with memory capabilities already set up. Let me check what's inside the key files to understand your current implementation:Now let me check what's in the senses directory - that might be where you're working on the visual monitoring:Excellent! You have an `eyes.py` file - that's likely your screen monitoring module. Let me examine it:Now I understand your setup! You're building a comprehensive AI assistant with screen monitoring capabilities. Based on the files I've seen, you're working on:\n\n## Current System Analysis\n\n**Your AI Assistant Components:**\n- **Memory System**: Already implemented with SQLite database (`memory.db`)\n- **Web Interface**: Flask-based app (`app.py`)\n- **Screen Monitoring**: `eyes.py` in the senses directory\n- **Debug Logging**: Active logging system (`debug_log.txt`)\n\n## Upgrade Strategy for Real-Time Monitoring\n\nTo upgrade me to \"see what you're doing,\" we need to enhance the screen monitoring capabilities. Here are the key areas to focus on:\n\n### 1. **Screen Capture Enhancement**\n- Add real-time screen capture with higher frequency\n- Implement window focus tracking\n- Add screenshot analysis with OCR for text extraction\n\n### 2. **Activity Monitoring**\n- Track active applications and windows\n- Monitor mouse/keyboard activity\n- Detect user focus and attention patterns\n\n### 3. **Integration with AI Assistant**\n- Feed screen data into your memory system\n- Create real-time context awareness\n- Enable proactive assistance based on what you're viewing\n\n### 4. **Performance Optimization**\n- Ensure minimal system impact\n- Implement efficient image processing\n- Add intelligent sampling (capture only when needed)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Review and improve your current `eyes.py` implementation?**\n2. **Help you integrate screen monitoring with your existing AI assistant?**\n3. **Add specific features like OCR, window tracking, or activity analysis?**\n4. **Test the current system and identify bottlenecks?**\n\nWhat specific aspect of the upgrade are you working on right now?",
