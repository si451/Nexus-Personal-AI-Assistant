This will be where all my future outputs will be stored.\n\n### Verification\n\nTo verify that the folder was created correctly, here's what you should see:\n\n```\n/Documents/NexusAIOutputs/\n|--- Nexus_AI_Assistant_Output_2023-12-01.json\n|--- Another_Nexus_AI_Assistant_Output.json\n```\n\nPlease note that these files are currently empty. As I generate outputs for our conversations, they will be stored in this folder.\n\n### Future Outputs\n\nFrom now on, all my outputs will be stored in the `/Documents/NexusAIOutputs` folder. This should help keep our conversation history organized and make it easier to review or retrieve specific output if needed.\n\nLet me know how I can assist you further!",
