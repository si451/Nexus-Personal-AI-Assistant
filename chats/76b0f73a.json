However, I don't have the capability to retain information between conversations - each time we interact, I start fresh without memory of previous discussions.\n\nFor securely storing important information like secret codes, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Using a password manager (like Bitwarden, LastPass, or KeePass)\n2. Writing it in a secure local file that only you can access\n3. Using encrypted notes or secure storage apps\n\nIf you need help setting up secure storage for your code or have another task you'd like assistance with, I'm here to help!
