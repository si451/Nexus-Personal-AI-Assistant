Below is a simple Python script that adds two numbers and runs it.\n\n```python\n# Define the function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n# Example usage of the function\nnum1 = 5\nnum2 = 10\nresult = add_numbers(num1, num2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}\")\n```\n\nTo run this script, you can use a Python environment or write it in a file and execute it using a terminal. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Option 1: Using a Python Environment\n\n1. Open a terminal.\n2. Run the following command to execute the script:\n   ```bash\n   python script_name.py\n   ```\n   Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your file.\n\n### Option 2: Writing the Script in a File and Running It\n\n1. Create a new Python file, for example, `add_numbers.py`, and paste the script above into it.\n2. Open a terminal.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/your/file/directory\n   ```\n4. Run the script by executing:\n   ```bash\n   python add_numbers.py\n   ```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe sum of 5 and 10 is: 15\n```\n\nFeel free to modify the numbers in the script to test with different values!",

However, I can provide you with some key points and references that you can use to research and write your report:\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **History and Development**: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. The first quantum computer was built in the early 1980s.\n\n2. **Quantum Bits (Qubits)**: Unlike classical bits which are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to their quantum properties, allowing for parallel processing and exponentially increased computational power.\n\n3. **Applications**:\n   - **Cryptography**: Quantum computers could potentially revolutionize cryptography by breaking current encryption methods like RSA.\n   - **Simulation**: Simulating complex systems like molecular structures or weather patterns can be much faster with quantum computers.\n   - **Optimization**: Solving optimization problems more efficiently than classical computers.\n\n4. **Challenges**:\n   - **Scalability**: Building a large-scale, reliable quantum computer is challenging due to decoherence and error rates.\n   - **Decoherence**: This occurs when quantum bits lose their quantum properties due to interaction with the environment.\n   - **Error Correction**: Developing robust error correction codes for qubits is crucial for maintaining the stability of quantum computations.\n\n5. **Current Research**:\n   - Quantum computing research is ongoing, and there are several companies and universities working on developing practical quantum computers.\n   - Projects like IBM's Q system and Google's Bristlecone quantum computer aim to build scalable quantum processors.\n\n6. **Future Outlook**: While quantum technology is still in its early stages, advancements suggest that it has the potential to solve problems that classical computers cannot efficiently tackle.\n\n### References\n\n1. **Quantum Computing Basics** - [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing)\n2. **Quantum Computing for Everyone** - [Book by John Preskill](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-for-Everyone/dp/0596374124)\n3. **IBM Quantum Platform Documentation** - [IBM Quantum Website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)\n4. **Google Research Blog Posts** - [Google's Quantum Computing Research](https://research.google.com/advances/quantum-machine-learning.html)\n\nIf you need to conduct a detailed report, I recommend using these resources to gather the latest information and insights on quantum technology. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!",
