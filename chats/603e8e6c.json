Let me check your active processes:Based on your active processes, here's what I can see you're doing right now:\n\n## Current Activity Analysis\n\n**Primary Activities:**\n- **Python Development**: Multiple Python processes running (`python.exe`)\n- **AI/LLM Work**: `ollama.exe` and related processes active\n- **Web Browsing**: Chrome with several tabs open\n- **Epic Games**: Epic Games Launcher running\n- **WhatsApp Desktop**: Active WhatsApp session\n- **Arduino Development**: Arduino Cloud Agent running\n- **VMware**: Virtualization tools active\n\n**Development Environment:**\n- You have PowerShell sessions open (multiple `powershell.exe` instances)\n- Python scripts running with significant memory usage (~1.3GB)\n- Ollama AI framework active\n- Language server running for development support\n\n**System Status:**\n- System is healthy with normal Windows processes\n- Multiple NVIDIA processes suggesting gaming/graphics work\n- Asus hardware utilities running (likely laptop-specific services)\n\nThe most prominent activity appears to be Python development work, possibly related to AI/LLM projects given the Ollama presence. You're also multitasking with web browsing, gaming launcher, and messaging apps.\n\nWant me to check anything specific about your current setup or help with any of these activities?",
